<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Online shopping is used by many people around the world. It is a popular method of finding the items you want without needing to drive to a physical location and wait in a checkout line. Companies which offer online shopping services are often interested in what factors lead to purchases; this project explores these factors and presents multiple models designed to predict whether or not a purchase will occur.

The main goal of this project is to use the program SAS Enterprise Miner and applications of classification algorithms, including decision trees, regression, neural networks, and random forests to create different types of classification models to predict the shopping intent of visitors to the website columbia.com.tr. With this knowledge, we will be able to classify who is likely to make a purchase and who is not among all visitors to the website.

This project also uses the application of cluster analysis to divide all website visitors into a number of groups which have different online shopping behaviors. Those visitor segments will provide businesses with a deeper understanding of online activities of the website visitors, and will help them to take actions accordingly to improve the purchase conversion rates and increase sales. 



<!-- DATA DESCRIPTION -->
## Data Description

The online shoppers purchasing intention dataset of this project is obtained from the website: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset. 

The dataset recorded 12,330 sessions to the website columbia.com.tr in a period of 10 months from February to December 2016. The dataset consisted of 10 numerical and 8 categorical variables shown in tables 1 and 2, respectively.
